Hi!  I am a Software Developer with hands-on experience in many different areas of software development.  I went to school in Edmonton, graduated in early 2017, and have been working in the industry since then.  I am an enthusiastic, supportive, team member who really enjoys solving difficult problems.  I have extensive experience in back-end development and have done front-end work as well.  I have also performed the responsibility of scrum master, helping lead to the release of successful projects.
