\lettersection{Why Me?}
While some may look at the number of years I have been working and decided that I am too new for a Senior Developer position, I have had a lot of experience fulfilling that role in the past.  Over the course of my career, Iâ€™ve broadened my skills in object-oriented design patterns, test-driven development, and collaboration with colleagues. This knowledge has enhanced my proficiency in writing easy to read, well-modularized, efficient code.

Beyond that, I am familiar with setting professional goals and achieving them. I have a proven track record of being able to conceive, plan, develop, and execute strategies resulting in well-written software. My development skills, coupled with my ability to work hard and be positive, will be of immediate value to Zenefits.
