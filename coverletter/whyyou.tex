\lettersection{Why Rescale?}
I came across your job posting on HackerNews and was immediately intrigued.
I have always been in support of consistent privacy for users across the internet.
In my opinion, the ease at which other people can track and see what we do across the internet is one of the most significant issues facing our society.  
It dramatically enhances the ability to perform mass surveillance and gives large organizations much more information about people than they would otherwise be able to get.
Furthermore, I have always been interested in making high-quality software.  
Ever since I took my first software engineering course, I have been fascinated by the use of design patterns, object-oriented principles, and clean-code techniques to make software more natural to read and less prone to bugs.  
It is primarily for these reasons that I hope you look kindly on my application for the Server Developer position that you have open.
