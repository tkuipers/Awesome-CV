\lettersection{Why GitHub}
The company that I am currently working for uses Azure DevOps. The problems that Azure DevOps solves and the scale at which they address them is intriguing to me.  I was inspired to reach out about this job posting after seeing how useful Azure DevOps can be for enabling collaboration across teams.  My preference and ability to work remotely would also make me an excellent fit for GitHub.  Furthermore, GitHub and Microsoft also contribute a lot to the open-source software movement, which aligns closely with my values.
