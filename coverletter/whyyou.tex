\lettersection{Why Zenefits}
I found your job posting on LinkedIn and was immediately intrigued.
After finding out more information from the Zenefits website, I can see how my goals align with the purposes of Zenefits.
There's nothing I love more than when I am working with other engaged individuals towards a common goal, and that's what excited me about working here.  
I see through GlassDoor reviews that Zenefits has a passion for delivering high-quality software to your customers and providing a great product to enable small businesses. 
Building products that are both high quality and useful is why I started this career, and I am excited at the prospect of working together towards this.
