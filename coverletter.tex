\begin{cvletter}
As an enthusiastic employee of AMA, I'm excited to formally apply for the agile team lead position.  As you are aware, since joining the development team in the insurance 
division, I've quickly mastered the skills required for my position and exceeded expectations in many areas.  I have become a central source of information, and am well 
regarded in the opinions of my peers.  While I am happy with my current position, working as a team lead is more in line with my long term career goals, and I feel that
my abilities will be an immediate asset to insurance IT.

Since I have begun working at AMA as a software developer, I have taken part in many initiatives that have resulted in increased throughput and modernization of our team.
I took a lead role in our transition from SVN to Git, resulting in a more comprehensive ADO solution which is used every day by developers and others.  I took a leadership role
in many of the initiatives completed during my employment, all of which were largely succesful.  I spearheaded the unit testing initiative which is being worked into a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that we 
will use to increase code quality in the future.  This has resulted in more stability to our system in the past, and ideally will continue to impact quality.

I have read the requirements for the team lead position thouroughly.  Although I may not be a perfect match for the position, I'm confident that the skills I have 
developed over my career, along with my passion for software development will make me an ideal fit for the role.

I appreciate your time and consideration, and look forward to discussing this at your convenience.  Please let me know if there is any other information
I can provide for you, I'd be happy to send it your way.
