\begin{cvletter}
I have impacted business outcomes throughout my career through effective organization, prioritization, and execution of critical
projects. Since accepting my position as a software team lead, I’ve quickly mastered the skills required for this position and am
looking for jobs with a more significant impact. My skills and qualifications are an ideal match for playing a pivotal role in TD’s Guidewire
cloud upgrade.

Previously, in my lead and software development roles, I have impacted AMA’s development methodology to a large degree. I
have integrated a test suite into our product, led multiple initiatives with successful outcomes, and organized crucial components
of AMA’s Guidewire implementation. I am independently motivated but also collaborate well with colleagues and other teams. As
demonstrated on my attached resume, I am knowledgeable in many facets of software development. Specifically, I have much
experience in Guidewire’s PolicyCenter, CustomerEngage, and leading teams.

I have read the requirements for your Guidewire position thoroughly. Although I may not be a perfect match for the role, I’m
confident that the skills I have developed over my career, along with my passion for software development, will make me an ideal
fit for the role.

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to discussing this at your convenience. Please let me know if there is
any other information I can provide for you; I’d be happy to send it your way.
