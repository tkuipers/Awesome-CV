\begin{cvletter}
I am writing regarding your job posting for a Software Engineer on HackerNews.  

I saw your job posting and immediately felt that I would be a good fit for your engineering role.
While I have little experience in Machine Learning, I am enthusiastic about learning new things and bringing expertise in many other software development areas.
Over the course of my career, I have broadened my skills in object-oriented design patterns, test-driven development, and collaboration with colleagues. 
This knowledge has enabled me to write complex, reusable code that has been instrumental in high-performance systems.

I currently have much experience in writing enterprise software, as shown in my experience at Lockheed Martin and Alberta Motor Association.
While these have been great jobs, the challenges of working at a startup attracted me to your posting.
I am excited to work in an environment where I can gain experience in areas other than enterprise software.
Beyond that, I am familiar with setting professional goals and achieving them. 
I have a proven track record of conceiving, planning, developing, and executing strategies resulting in well-written software. 
I know that my development skills, coupled with my ability to work hard and be positive, will be of immediate value to AirGrid.
